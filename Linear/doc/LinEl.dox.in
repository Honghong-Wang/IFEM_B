/*! \mainpage Isogemetric FEM Linear %Elasticity application

\author Knut Morten Okstad, SINTEF Digital, Trondheim

\section intro Introduction
This is a linear elasticity application built on top of the IFEM library.
It solves the static linear elasticity equations for 2D or 3D continuum domains,
as well as for some beam and plate formulations.
The application can also perform eigenvalue analysis (free vibration and
linearized buckling), and perform adaptive analysis, based on either
the exact error distributions (for problems with known analytical solution)
or recovery-based error estimates.

Refer to the documents in the sub-folder <i>doc/Integrands</i>
for the underlying equations forming the basis of the integrand implementations.

IFEM is an object-oriented toolbox for implementing isogeometric finite element
(FE) solvers for linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
The toolbox is developed through the ICADA project at SINTEF ICT, Trondheim.
The purpose of this code is to serve as a common base for isogeometric
PDE-simulators, using splines and NURBS as basis functions in the FE
formulations. The toolbox contains methods for doing linear and nonlinear,
stationary and dynamic time-domain analyses, as well as eigenvalue analyses.
